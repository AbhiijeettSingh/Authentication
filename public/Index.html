    <p class="text-white text-center text-base m-4 w-1/2 mx-auto" >Lord Krishna is a central figure in Hinduism and is considered to be the eighth avatar of the god Vishnu. He is revered as a divine teacher, philosopher, and guide, and is often depicted as a young boy or a charming man playing a flute. Krishna is known for his many adventures and exploits, as well as his role in the ancient Indian epic, the Mahabharata. He is also considered to be a supreme God in his own right, and is worshiped as the embodiment of love, compassion, and Godhead. </p>
